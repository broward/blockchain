Blockchain
----------

Goals:

1)  Initial sql schema

		I had a hard finding a blockchain sql script that actually worked.
		I recreated my own script from an E-R pdf and genericized it to run on MySQL and Postgres.

2)  Host the schema

		Schema works
		http://nodemy-blockchain.herokuapp.com/

3)  Message feed into schema

4)  Translate sql to graph db
		
		Using neo4j as the graph db because it's hosted free on heroku

5)  host graph db

		https://app.graphenedb.com/dbs/app41881550/overview
		

6)  message feed/demo page

7)  Translate sql to couchbase schema

8)  host it?  maybe not

9)  message feed/demo page
