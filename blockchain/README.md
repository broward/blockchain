Blockchain
----------

Goals:

1)  Initial sql schema

		I had a hard finding a blockchain sql script that actually worked.
		I recreated my own script from an E-R pdf and genericized it to run on MySQL and Postgres.

2)  Host the schema

3)  Message feed into schema

4)  Translate sql to graph db

5)  host graph db

6)  message feed/demo page

7)  Translate sql to couchbase schema

8)  host it?  maybe not

9)  message feed/demo page
